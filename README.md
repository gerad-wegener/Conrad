# Configurable Occipital Network for Real-Time Autonomous Drones

This repo is for developers to work on creating and adding functionality to an autonomous drone. There are no required sprints, reviews, planning etc. This project is for developers and collaborators to have fun coding, brainstorming and contributing anything they desire. Hopefully by the end, we will have a cool side project. There are only three main rules for now (There's no way to enforce these rules, so I'm more so just asking so everyone is happy as we constantly approach the end of the project.)


1) Do not associate this project in anyway with the professional environment.


    a) No coding can be done on work laptops
    b) Work emails can not be associated with the project itself (Planning is fine, sharing code over work emails is not)
    c) Nothing that the employers pay for can be used to develop this project (need our own personal resharper etc.)

2) Do not distribute or use code you DID NOT develop outside this project, unless developer approves.

    a) While the project as a whole belongs to the group, individuals code should still belong to the individual.
    b) If desired to use code someone else developed in a different project, get permission from that developer first.
    c) If a developer creates something cool (like a fantastic machine learning algorithm), they may want to use it for their own personal project, or take it to a different group project. There are no rules on what you can do with code you developed yourself.
    d) Any code checked into the repo can be used in the project by anybody, and can only be used as a reference outside the          project unless original developer says otherwise.
    e) If you take existing code from someone and extend it within the project, you need to get permission from that developer        before taking it outside the project.
 
 3) Share and Collaborate :)
    
    a) This project is going to be complex, rewarding, and most of all... Fun!
    b) Anyone can jump on any functionality piece they want too. They can even take a completely different approach to what          someone is doing/already did. Code in any language you want, work with whoever you want, or by yourself. 
    c) New people can of course get added to the project. I would like to keep it closed to TGW specific people for the              project but if there's someone who really wants to get involved and help collaborate, by all means add them!     
    d) When developing a piece of functionality try to have others test your code also so they can give constant critiques.
    e) We can also use this as a positive opportunity to learn from each other. 
     
(Also once the drone gets built, we might have to get a little more strict rules for safety.)
     
     
Future Planning:

I will be sending an email out over a period of time to update everyone on the status of each piece of functionality on the project. It could be 2 weeks, a month, etc. whichever works best for the project. There will be optional meetings where we can go over the changes that have been made and we can have general discussion on them. These discussions will be laid back and likely take place at a restaurant/bar. The best place to collaborate :). Anyone from TGW can join, please only include people outside of TGW if they are going to be highly dedicated to the success of the project or they can contribute a lot of knowledge to the group that will help us work toward the success. 


Goal:

The goal of the project is to have a fun side project we work on as a team to achieve the following base functionality. 

  1) The drone will know when a person (not an animal) has entered it's protected zone.
  2) The drone will authenticate that the person is allowed to enter the protected zone.
  3) The drone will initiate it's defense mechanism if determined the person is not authentic.
      a) After the person leaves, the drone will return to it's idle position and the system will reset.
  4) The drone will allow access to authenticated personal.

The main goal of the project to participate in something new and innovative, and to gain knowledge in areas we wouldn't otherwise delve into. The team will likely do research in different areas, and the knowledge would be beneficial to anybody once committed and shared with everyone. Before we even begin the project, we already know we are getting into AI, Machine Learning, Image Processing, circuits, robotics, networks and more. We're attempting to teach ourselves how to do some of the most complex things in technology. We will be most successful if this knowledge is shared throughout the group. Ideally when we get committed to learning about a specific topic, we should also be just as committed to teaching others who are interested in that topic. Once base functionality is achieved, we can move on to adding more functionality on top of whats already done. 

There is no goal as of now to make this a profitable product in anyway. The group should come into the project only hoping to gain knowledge and help to create something cool, fun and innovative. Although, if the group beleives the project does get realized as something that can be profitable, we can hold discussions pertaining to profits if the time comes. If enough people from the group decide the project could be profitable, no more new developers/collaborators could join from that point on until the group agrees on plans to move forward. Remember, code that was developed by a developer belongs to that developer. That developer needs to give permission for their code to be used in anyway outside the project, or if their code became profitable for the project. Anyone who helped develop and collaborate will be included in the project after it's closed if profiting does become an objective, whether they contributed code, ideas, information or took part in the success of the project in anyway. Again profit is NOT the objective of this project, but if we create something cool with potential, the option is not off the table.  


Safety:

After the drone gets built, it can be used by anybody to test anything they desire. Please do take extra precaution when using the drone, pi, or any physical pieces. I am planning on things getting physically broken throughout the project. That is completely ok, accidents happen, and the individual parts are cheap and easy to replace. When doing anything with the physical hardware, please try to take the most safe and cautious approach with everybody including yourself in mind. We usually deal with much more dangerous pieces of equipment, but damage/harm can still be done and best if risky actions are avoided. Mostly for safety the drone should be flown indoors only, unless confident the drone won't damage or hurt anyone. My garage can be used as a trial space, but if you have your own indoor space also this is fine. Also this drone does have some powerful motors. Please wear clothes that cover your body, with safety glasses when flying the drone at all times. Please test the functionality indoors before letting the drone go outside. Also when testing outside, try to use a soft surface, away from people, and use a strong string of some sort to tether the drone to a stationary object, but not yourself. I have an outdoor dog leash that goes into the ground, and we can use strong twin to keep the drone from breaking away from the string. We want to keep the drone from flying off and potentially causing damage or harm, but we also want to make sure it wont hurt us in anyway also. On top of that the string will prevent the drone from potentially getting lost. The person who currently is in possession the drone would be the one who is responsbile if the drone damages or hurts anyone. The group will not be held responsible. I'll try to put as much protection pieces on the drone as possible, but nothing is guaranteed. No one is responsible if the drone gets damaged in anyway, I'm expecting this to happen a lot. The most fragile pieces are the cheapest and the whole drone itself is not very expensive. Soft ground will help when the drone crashes. 

Ready, set, INNOVATE!
